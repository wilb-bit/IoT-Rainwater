# IoT-Rainwater-Webserver
Penultimate year project

•	Engineered a solar-powered Internet of Things (IoT) device to remotely monitor the fullness of a rainwater tank, from anywhere with an internet connection (lifetime: 10+ years).

• Apache webserver developed (HTML, PHP, SQL) with a login system, a MySQL database, Graphical User Interface (GUI), and an API for communication with an IoT device (ESP8266). IoT device programmed with C++.

This was the webserver used for the project. XAMPP was installed to have a Apache web server and MySQL database running on my computer.
